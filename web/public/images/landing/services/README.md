# Services carousel

**Use for:** Centered carousel showing three services (image + title + short description).

## Files to add

One image per service:

1. **Renting houses** – Suggested name: `renting.png` or `renting.webp`
2. **Buying houses** – Suggested name: `buying.png` or `buying.webp`
3. **Selling homes** – Suggested name: `selling.png` or `selling.webp`

**Tips:** Use landscape or square (e.g. 400×300px or 600×400px). Consistent aspect ratio (e.g. 4:3) keeps the carousel tidy.
